ReplayGain reference level: -14 LUFS
EBU R128 reference level: -23 LUFS

So, ReplayGain is 5 dB louder than R128.

Plan:
* Optionally store R128 album gain in stream header gain field
  (If this is disabled, header gain field will be left unmodified)
* Store R128 album gain in R128_ALBUM_GAIN comment, relative to stream header
  gain (Note that if the stream header contains the album gain, this tag will
  contain an adjustment of 0 dB)
* Store R128 track gain in R128_TRACK_GAIN comment, relative to stream header
  gain
* Store ReplayGain album gain in REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN field, relative to
  stream header gain
* Store ReplayGain track gain in REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN field, relative to
  stream header gain
